the MeSDK provides a light and small object implementation for core developing
it includes the MeObjects, MeRTTI, and MeAOP etc.

The MeAOP Library is Aspect Oriented Programming for delphi. IMO, the aspect is the general feature in fact. It's a helper for
object-oriented programming to re-use the feature(function), such as the Login feature. Aspect Oriented Programming
attempts to aid programmers in the separation of features, or the breaking down of a program into distinct parts that
overlap in functionality as little as possible.

  * distill/separate the general features from many classes;
  * many classes can share the feature, so it need not to modify many classes if the feature've been changed.
  * no necessary to modify the method when adding a new feature to the method.


# MeObjects #
MeObjects Library for Delphi is a light object extension to make object type small and powerful. It makes the object type
supports the ClassType, InheritsFrom and ClassName like the Class Type, but it's mini and faster than the delphi class type.
You can treat it as mini-class type. The MeObjects Library is the MeSDK core too.

# MeRTTI #
the Mini Run-time Type Infomation object derived from MeObjects. the MeType is stream-able.

# MeAOP #
The MeAOP Library is Aspect Oriented Programming for delphi. IMO, the aspect is the general feature in fact. It's a helper for
object-oriented programming to re-use the feature(function), such as the Login feature. Aspect Oriented Programming

I treat the Aspect Oriented Programming as Feature Oriented Programming.

# MeRemote #
The MeRemote Features Library is the remote function and remote object Library for delphi. It's the feature-layer for the MeAOP.

# MeService #
The MeService Library is a mini general SOA(service(plugin)-oriented architecture) system framework.

# MeScript #
the MeSDK Script Engine Core. It's the functional language script engine. but not ready yet.
